      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <div className="container">
        <p> At TutorSphere, we believe that education should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial background. We are a team of passionate developers with a mission to create a platform that provides free tutoring services to underprivileged children. Our team includes Soundarya Baskar, Syed Ashar, Varsha George, Akshay Jagadeesh, Saksham Sangraula, and Samriddhi Sangraula, all of whom are committed to making a difference in the lives of these students.
        </p>
        <p> We understand the transformative power of education and its impact on shaping one's future. By offering free tutoring services, we hope to give underprivileged children the opportunity to learn and succeed academically. We believe that every child deserves a chance to reach their full potential, and we are dedicated to making that a reality through our unique tutoring platform.
        </p>
        <p> Our online tutoring application is designed to provide academic support to those who need it most. Volunteer tutors can sign up for a tutor account and deliver free tutoring sessions to underprivileged students in need of academic assistance. The Tutorsphere website will allow users to schedule appointments with tutors based on their availability and subject expertise. Both tutors and students will be able to view upcoming appointments and cancel them if needed.
        </p>
        <p> There are several online tutoring platforms available in the market, but our platform is unique as it focuses on financially disadvantaged students and is entirely free of cost. Our platform is easy to use and has a user-friendly interface that makes it accessible for students who may not have access to expensive resources. We expect to see an increase in academic performance among underprivileged students who use our platform for academic support.
        </p>
        <p> Our project plan for TutorSphere is to create an online tutoring application that generates an effective method of communication amongst underprivileged students and tutors who are willing to volunteer their time. We expect to attract a large pool of volunteer tutors from UT Dallas who are passionate about giving back to their communities and helping students succeed academically.
